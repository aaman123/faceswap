# OPTIONS THAT APPLY TO ALL MODELS
# NB: UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED, VALUES CHANGED HERE WILL ONLY TAKE EFFECT WHEN CREATING A NEW MODEL.

# How much of the extracted image to train on. A lower coverage will limit the model's scope to a zoomed-in central area while higher amounts can include the entire face. A trade-off exists between lower amounts given more detail versus higher amounts avoiding noticeable swap transitions. Sensible values to use are:
# 	62.5%% spans from eyebrow to eyebrow.
# 	75.0%% spans from temple to temple.
# 	87.5%% spans from ear to ear.
# 	100.0%% is a mugshot.
# 
# Select a decimal number between 62.5 and 100.0
# [Default: 68.75]
coverage = 68.75

# Use ICNR to tile the default initializer in a repeating pattern. This strategy is designed for pairing with sub-pixel / pixel shuffler to reduce the 'checkerboard effect' in image reconstruction. 
# 	 https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.02937.pdf
# 
# Choose from: True, False
# [Default: False]
icnr_init = False

# Use Convolution Aware Initialization for convolutional layers. This can help eradicate the vanishing and exploding gradient problem as well as lead to higher accuracy, lower loss and faster convergence.
# NB:
# 	 This can use more VRAM when creating a new model so you may want to lower the batch size for the first run. The batch size can be raised again when reloading the model. 
# 	 Multi-GPU is not supported for this option, so you should start the model on a single GPU. Once training has started, you can stop training, enable multi-GPU and resume.
# 	 Building the model will likely take several minutes as the calculations for this initialization technique are expensive. This will only impact starting a new model.
# 
# Choose from: True, False
# [Default: False]
conv_aware_init = False

# The optimizer to use.
# 	 adam - Adaptive Moment Optimization. A stochastic gradient descent method that is based on adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
# 	 nadam - Adaptive Moment Optimization with Nesterov Momentum. Much like Adam but uses a different formula for calculating momentum.
# 	 rms-prop - Root Mean Square Propogation. Maintains a moving (discounted) average of the square of the gradients. Divides the gradient by the root of this average.
# 
# Choose from: ['adam', 'nadam', 'rms-prop']
# [Default: adam]
optimizer = adam

# Learning rate - how fast your network will learn (how large are the modifications to the model weights after one batch of training). Values that are too large might result in model crashes and the inability of the model to find the best solution. Values that are too small might be unable to escape from dead-ends and find the best global minimum.
# 
# This option can be updated for existing models.
# Select a decimal number between 1e-06 and 0.0001
# [Default: 5e-05]
learning_rate = 5e-05

# Use reflection padding rather than zero padding with convolutions. Each convolution must pad the image boundaries to maintain the proper sizing. More complex padding schemes can reduce artifacts at the border of the image.

# 
# Choose from: True, False
# [Default: False]

# [Nvidia Only]. Enable the Tensorflow GPU 'allow_growth' configuration option. This option prevents Tensorflow from allocating all of the GPU VRAM at launch but can lead to higher VRAM fragmentation and slower performance. Should only be enabled if you are receiving errors regarding 'cuDNN fails to initialize' when commencing training.
# 
# This option can be updated for existing models.
# Choose from: True, False
# [Default: False]
allow_growth = False

# [Nvidia Only], NVIDIA GPUs can run operations in float16 faster than in float32. Mixed precision allows you to use a mix of float16 with float32, to get the performance benefits from float16 and the numeric stability benefits from float32.
# 
# While mixed precision will run on most Nvidia models, it will only speed up training on more recent GPUs. Those with compute capability 7.0 or higher will see the greatest performance benefit from mixed precision because they have Tensor Cores. Older GPUs offer no math performance benefit for using mixed precision, however memory and bandwidth savings can enable some speedups. Generally RTX GPUs and later will offer the most benefit.
# 
# Choose from: True, False
# [Default: False]
mixed_precision = False

# [GPU Only]. The number of faces to feed through the model at once when running the Convert process.
# 
# NB: Increasing this figure is unlikely to improve convert speed, however, if you are getting Out of Memory errors, then you may want to reduce the batch size.
# 
# This option can be updated for existing models.
# Select an integer between 1 and 32
# [Default: 16]

[global.loss]
# LOSS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# LOSS IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH A NEURAL NETWORK JUDGES HOW WELL IT THINKS THAT IT IS RECREATING A FACE.
# NB: UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED, VALUES CHANGED HERE WILL ONLY TAKE EFFECT WHEN CREATING A NEW MODEL.

# The loss function to use.
# 	 MAE - Mean absolute error will guide reconstructions of each pixel towards its median value in the training dataset. Robust to outliers but as a median, it can potentially ignore some infrequent image types in the dataset.
# 	 MSE - Mean squared error will guide reconstructions of each pixel towards its average value in the training dataset. As an avg, it will be suspectible to outliers and typically produces slightly blurrier results.
# 	 LogCosh - log(cosh(x)) acts similiar to MSE for small errors and to MAE for large errors. Like MSE, it is very stable and prevents overshoots when errors are near zero. Like MAE, it is robust to outliers. NB: Due to a bug in PlaidML, this loss does not work on AMD cards.
# 	 Smooth_L1 --- Modification of the MAE loss to correct two of its disadvantages. This loss has improved stability and guidance for small errors.
# 	 L_inf_norm --- The L_inf norm will reduce the largest individual pixel error in an image. As each largest error is minimized sequentially, the overall error is improved. This loss will be extremely focused on outliers.
# 	 SSIM - Structural Similarity Index Metric is a perception-based loss that considers changes in texture, luminance, contrast, and local spatial statistics of an image. Potentially delivers more realistic looking images.
# 	 GMSD - Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation seeks to match the global standard deviation of the pixel to pixel differences between two images. Similiar in approach to SSIM. NB: This loss does not currently work on AMD cards.
# 	 Pixel_Gradient_Difference - Instead of minimizing the difference between the absolute value of each pixel in two reference images, compute the pixel to pixel spatial difference in each image and then minimize that difference between two images. Allows for large color shifts,but maintains the structure of the image.

# [Default: ssim]

# The loss function to use when learning a mask.
# 	 MAE - Mean absolute error will guide reconstructions of each pixel towards its median value in the training dataset. Robust to outliers but as a median, it can potentially ignore some infrequent image types in the dataset.

# 	 400 - Will give the penalty function 4x as much importance as the main loss function.
